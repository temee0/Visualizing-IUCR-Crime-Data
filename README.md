![](https://github.com/temee0/Visualizing-IUCR-Crime-Data/blob/main/front_page.jpg)

## Introduction
This report is a meticulous examination of crimes cataloged under the **Illinois Uniform Crime Reporting (IUCR)** system, spanning from 2001 to the present day. The IUCR, a standardized method for classifying criminal offenses, offers a comprehensive framework for organizing and interpreting diverse criminal activities, providing invaluable insights into the evolving nature and patterns of crime over the years. Within this report, there are subsections derived from the main data that focus on child-related crimes, sex crimes, and homicides.

Structured Query Language (SQL) was utilized to understand the crime dynamics, thereby facilitating informed decision-making and targeted interventions. To further enhance our insights and analysis, I used PowerBI to bring the data to life through interactive and visually compelling dashboards. This combination of SQL and Power BI not only deepened our understanding of the crime trends but also allowed for more effective communication of my findings to end users.
